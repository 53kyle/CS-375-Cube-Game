For my final project, I would like to create a version of this game:

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cube-runner/id284596345

It happens to be the first game I ever played on an iPhone in like 2008 or 2009, and it seems reasonable for me to actually create considering the models are mostly cubes with the exception of the player "character" which is a simple arrow. 

I don't know what environment I would like to program this in or which language I should use. I imagine it's doable using three.js but on the other hand, I'm not very confident with using javascript. If you have any recommendations, I'll go with whatever makes sense.
